Hello and welcome to SoyniblerBot's doc.

Make a python venv with the name of .venv

    $ python -m venv .venv

    and activate it by running

    $ source .venv/bin/activate

Then install requirements from le requirements.txt using

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt


Before YOU can run this bot YOU need to create "config.json" file with the entry...

    {
    "token": "put your token inside these funny little quotation marks"
    }

Then you should be able to run this bad boy with

    $ python soyniblerbot.py

voil√†, summa summarum, lorem ipsum, Metallica - Entersandman, carpe diem and memento mori you are done. Good Saab now go have fun with your friends.
